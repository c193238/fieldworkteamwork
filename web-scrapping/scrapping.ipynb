      "Govt scraps black money whitening facility\n",
      "02 Sep 2024 19:59:31\n",
      "Body : \n",
      "The National Board of Revenue (NBR) has scrapped the opportunity to whiten black money by paying 15 per cent tax.\n",
      "The NBR on Monday issued an SRO in this regard.\n",
      "The deposed Sheikh Hasina government in the last budget allowed black money to be whitened by buying immovable assets, including land, flats and plots, along with cash by paying 15 per cent tax.\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120529839-0\"); });\n",
      "The decision to cancel the facility was taken at the Advisory Council of the interim government last week.\n",
      "In continuation of this, the NBR officially canceled the opportunity to whiten black money.\n",
      "This opportunity was given by the previous government for one year from July 1 to June 30, 2025. There was an opportunity to whiten the cash earned through bribery and corruption by paying 15 per cent tax.\n",
      "On August 25, Finance and Commerce Adviser Dr Salehuddin Ahmed categorically said the government would not allow anyone to generate black money anymore.\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120733510-0\"); });\n",
      "“Our decision is clear, there will be no scope to generate black money anymore,” he said while responding to a question after holding a view exchange meeting with the UN representatives in Bangladesh held at the Economic Relations Division conference room in the city.\n",
      "National Board of Revenue (NBR) Chairman Md Abdur Rahman Khan on August 18 has strongly criticised the practice of whitening black money, calling it an “indecent deed” and “totally unacceptable,” during a view exchange meeting with his fellow colleagues.\n",
      "Almost all governments allowed legalisation of black money in the country, but the response was negligible.\n",
      "According to NBR sources, about Tk 47,000 crore has been legalised so far.\n",
      "However, there was no scope to whiten black money during the 1991-96 tenure of the BNP government.\n",
      "Lastly, in the financial year 2022-23, the opportunity to bring back the money smuggled from the country was given, but no one took this opportunity. A year later, another opportunity was given to whiten black money.\n",

      "He raised the issued at a meeting with the chairmen and CEOs of all public and private life insurance companies at the IDRA office in Dhaka on Wednesday. Newly appointed IDRA Chairman M Aslam Alam arranged the meeting.\n",
      "Fakrul questioned the role of IDRA during the massive corruption scandal, which spanned more than 10 years. He pointed out that the regulatory body was unable to detect such widespread corruption and, as a result, should also take responsibility for this oversight.\n",

      "Out of this, Tk 854 crore was used for illegal land acquisition, Tk 659.67 crore was invested in various companies associated with their interests, Tk 421 crore was obtained through bank loans against the company's Mudaraba term deposits, and Tk 192 crore was embezzled through two fake social organisations.\n",
      "Sources from the meeting revealed that the chairmen and CEOs of the insurance companies discussed the problems in the sector and proposed solutions.\n",

      "Many CEOs stated that, between 2020 and 2024, Tk 50 crore has been misappropriated through the Unified Messaging Platform (UMP). To restore order, the sharing of company information and funds through the UMP must be stopped immediately.\n",
      "The IDRA chairman emphasised the need for cooperation from everyone to restore discipline in the sector. He mentioned that the reforms initiated by student protests must now be advanced to the development stage. Additionally, he warned that if any wrongdoing occurs or if the public is deprived of their rights, the students and the masses will rise to stop it. He urged everyone to conduct business by following the law.\n",

      "Bangladesh Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) for the month of August, jointly released by the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI), Dhaka and Policy Exchange Bangladesh (PEB), has indicated improvement in the general economy.\n",
      "While still in contraction mode with a reading below 50 indicating an overall slowdown, the August 2024 PMI said the interim government has been working tirelessly to rebuild political stability and ensure normal business operations across sectors following the fall of the Awami League regime.\n",
      "Previously in July, the index fell by 27 points to a record low of 36.9 due to widespread unrest and extreme measures taken by the previous Awami regime before their eventual fall, said a press release.\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120529839-0\"); });\n",
      "The PMI is a pioneering initiative that aims to offer timely and accurate insights into the country's economic health to help businesses, investors and policymakers make informed decisions.\n",
      "It was developed by MCCI and Policy Exchange, with support from the UK government and technical support from the Singapore Institute of Purchasing & Materials Management (SIPMM).\n",
      "Bangladesh's overall PMI score in August saw an increase of 6.6 points from July to reach 43.5.\n",
      "PMI is a forward-looking economic indicator that helps identify the turning points in the business cycle and provides an early indication of where the economy is headed.\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120733510-0\"); });\n",
      "Encompassing crucial sectors such as agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and services, the PMI summarizes whether markets are expanding, staying the same, or contracting through regular surveys of senior executives in the private sector.\n",
      "According to PMI, an index above 50 signals expansion while a figure below 50 suggests contraction relative to the previous month.\n",
      "Hasnat Alam, economist and senior manager of Policy Exchange, delivered a keynote highlighting the methodology used in compiling the index every month and elaborated on the key findings of August PMI, shedding light on the broad pillar areas in each sector.\n",
      "The manufacturing sector recorded an increase of 13.6 points to reach 47.7 in August, indicating continued contraction but a slower rate with general improvements in the indexes of new orders, new exports, imports, supplier deliveries, factory output and order backlogs compared to the previous month.\n",
      "Employment, input purchases, finished goods, and order backlog indices, however, reverted to contraction.\n",
      "The agriculture sector, after six months of continuous expansion before July, recorded 38.7 in August after improving by 3.3 points. New business, business activities, and employment indices saw a slower contraction, while the input cost index recorded a slower expansion.\n",
      "The construction sector recorded a contraction for the second month and at a faster rate, deteriorating by five points from July.\n",
      "The sector posted a faster contraction in the indexes of new business and construction activity. The input cost and order backlog indices also remained on the expansion track, indicating a poor environment for construction activities. The sector score was 40 in August.\n",
      "The PMI score for the service sector in August recorded 43.2, an improvement of 6.2 points from July. New business and business activities indices saw slower contraction compared to the previous month, while the employment index experienced rapid contraction.\n",
      "The input cost index recorded slower expansion, but the order backlog index returned to expansion indicating difficulties to meet pent-up orders from the previous month.\n",
      "Although all sectors posted contraction readings in August for two months straight, there was slight improvement in manufacturing, agriculture and service sectors.\n",
      "Companies are cautiously optimistic about the economic outlook as the future business index continues to record expansion readings for all key sectors of the economy, although at a slower rate for key sectors compared to the previous month.\n",
      "MCCI Secretary General and CEO Farooq Ahmed, in his concluding remarks, mentioned while there were a few weeks of stability after the revolution, business operations were hampered by various incidents of unrest that led to the closure of many factories.\n",
      "Recovering completely from the economic turmoil noticed in the month of July, however, would take strict restoration of law and order and political stability to keep factories running.\n",

      "This movement impacted July remittance inflow, dropping it to $1.91 billion. However, the situation changed for the better after the fall of the Hasina regime on August 5.\n",

      "The interim government has decided to keep the Universal Pension Scheme (UPS) in place until a new system is introduced, according to the Ministry of Finance.\n",
      "The decision follows a meeting chaired by Finance Adviser Salehuddin Ahmed on Monday, where the current state of the pension scheme was thoroughly reviewed.\n",
      "\"The Universal Pension Scheme will continue as it is for now, in line with the adviser's approval,\" said Finance Secretary Khairuzzaman Majumdar, confirming the outcome of the meeting to UNB.\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120529839-0\"); });\n",
      "The scheme, which was launched last year, aims to provide a sustainable social security framework for the entire population.\n",
      "Golam Mostafa, a member of the Universal Pension authority, added that during the meeting, discussions covered the four existing schemes under the UPS—Probash, Progoti, Surakkha, and Samata—and their operations.\n",
      "\"We have briefed the finance adviser on our activities so far. Based on that, he has decided to maintain the current structure until further notice,\" Mostafa said.\n",
      "He also noted that the ongoing operations would persist until a new scheme is announced. Regarding investments made from the pension contributions, Mostafa revealed that a total of Tk 116.69 crore has been invested entirely in government treasury bonds.\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120733510-0\"); });\n",
      "The UPS was introduced to bring people from all walks of life under a comprehensive social security system. Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the scheme on August 17, 2023, and registrations began shortly afterwards.\n",
      "Initially, the then government launched four schemes—Probash (for expatriate Bangladeshis), Progoti, Surakkha, and Samata. A fifth scheme, Prottoy, was later introduced for employees of autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies, but it was later scrapped following protests by teachers.\n",
      "As of now, 372,094 people have registered for the UPS, contributing a total of Tk 123.56 crore. Out of this, Tk 116.69 crore has been invested in government treasury bonds.\n",
      "Notably, a significant portion of the registrations, about 77 per cent, has come from low-income individuals who are part of the Samata scheme, which targets those earning less than Tk 60,000 annually.\n",
      "However, the pace of new registrations has slowed since the fall of the Awami League government following student protests.\n",
      "A high-ranking official from the Ministry of Finance attributed this decline to the political instability surrounding the government's fall. \"It's natural that the registration process slowed during the upheaval,\" the official said.\n",
      "The ministry officials believe that once the interim government expands its operations and begins promoting the Universal Pension Scheme, registration numbers will increase again.\n",

      "In recent weeks, rice prices have spiked in Dhaka’s markets, with traders attributing the surge to ongoing floods. Conversations with retailers and wholesalers across several markets in the capital revealed that sellers have been gradually raising rice prices, resulting in an increase of approximately Tk 250 to Tk 320 per 50 kg sack over the past month.\n",
      "However, industry analysts argue that blaming the price hikes on floods is baseless, as the flood-affected regions are not major rice-supplying areas for the country.\n",
      "Despite claims by some retailers and wholesalers that the floods have led to a price surge, data from the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) indicates a modest increase in rice prices over the last month. Fine rice has seen a 4.35 per cent rise, Paijam rice has increased by 2.68 per cent and coarse (Swarna) rice has risen by 2.88 per cent.\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120529839-0\"); });\n",
      "Masum Mia, owner of Masum Traders in Khilgaon's wholesale market, said that rice prices have been on an upward trend for some time. He explained that since the onset of the floods, prices have increased by Tk 1 to Tk 2 per kg, with the cost of a 50 kg sack rising by Tk 50 even before the floods began.\n",
      "He also mentioned that significant quantities of rice are being purchased for relief efforts due to the floods. However, this increased demand has not been met by adequate supply in large wholesale markets, pushing prices higher.\n",
      "Asaduzzaman, a rice vendor at the Malibagh rail gate market and owner of Maa Traders echoed similar concerns. He reported that over the past 15 days, the price per sack of rice has risen by Tk 320, while wholesale market prices have increased by Tk 250 to Tk 280 per sack.\n",
      "Mill price hikes driving up wholesale costs\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120733510-0\"); });\n",
      "In terms of specific prices, Badsha Mia, owner of Shariatpur Rice, shared that consumers are now paying Tk 58 to Tk 60 per kg for Swarna coarse rice, which was sold at Tk 52 to Tk 54 just 15 days ago and Tk 50 a month earlier.\n",
      "He further said that rice mills are currently selling Swarna rice for Tk 2,500 per sack, up from Tk 2,200 15 days ago. BR-28 rice, previously priced at Tk 2,450 per sack, is now being sold for Tk 2,700. A month ago, this variety was priced at Tk 2,250 per sack.\n",
      "At the consumer level, the typical profit margin per sack ranges from Tk 50 to Tk 80, he explained.\n",
      "Wholesale market prices are influenced by those set by the mills. If mills increase their prices, wholesalers follow suit, leading to higher prices for consumers. Badsha Mia stressed the need for oversight to prevent price hikes at the mill level.\n",
      "Government rice reserve\n",
      "According to the Ministry of Food, as of September 4, the government’s warehouses hold a total of 1.481 million tonnes of rice, including 107,000 tonnes of newly added paddy. Excluding the paddy, there are 1.374 million tonnes of rice, which is 22 per cent less than last year. Government sources, however, claim this stock is sufficient for three months.\n",
      "TCB reports on rice price\n",
      "The TCB reported that as of September 10, the minimum price of fine rice (Najir/Miniket) was Tk 64, with a maximum price of Tk 80. A month ago, the minimum price was Tk 60 and the maximum was Tk 78. Over the past month, Najir/Miniket rice prices have increased by 4.35 per cent.\n",
      "Additionally, the price of medium-quality Paijam or Lata rice has risen by 2.68 per cent over the past month. A month ago, the maximum price for this rice was Tk 58 per kilogram and it is now being sold for Tk 60.\n",
      "Swarna or China IRRI rice, which was priced at a maximum of Tk 54 per kilogram a month ago, is now Tk 55, marking an increase of 2.88 per cent over the past month.\n",
      "Flood-related price hikes illogical\n",
      "Ghulam Rahman, former president of the Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB), criticised the current instability in the rice market, calling it illogical. He noted that despite the floods being cited as a reason for price increases, the regions most affected are not major rice suppliers.\n",
      "Rahman also highlighted that inflation remains in double digits and that rising inflation typically drives up the prices of essential commodities. He emphasised the need for the interim government to address inflation to prevent further price increases.\n",
      "The Directorate of National Consumers' Rights Protection has reported ongoing operations across the country, including in the capital. The agency is actively reviewing rice prices and taking legal action against those exploiting consumers. The directorate has assured that any identified irregularities will be promptly addressed, with strict penalties imposed on offenders.\n",

      "Prime Islami Life Insurance Limited (PILIL) is under investigation for making risky investments totalling Tk 198.31 crore, bypassing the regulatory mandate to invest in government securities.\n",
      "An investigation by the Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority (IDRA) has revealed that the company channelled these funds into questionable ventures, including Zero Coupon Bonds (10 per cent convertible), short-term investments along with BO account investment, and accounts with entities such as Banglalion and Sterling Group.\n",
      "PILIL is now pursuing legal recourse to recover these funds.\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120529839-0\"); });\n",

      "According to the IDRA guidelines, insurance companies are required to invest 30 per cent of their paid-up capital in government securities.\n",
      "However, the investigation reported that PILIL has underinvested the amount when compared to the target outlined in its latest financial statement.\n",
      "Prime Islami Life Insurance's Tk 4.99 crore-worth investment in a Zero Coupon Bond issued by Banglalion in 2013 has become a significant concern, as highlighted by the investigation. The bond, which includes a 10 per cent convertible option, was supposed to begin redemption after three fiscal years.\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120733510-0\"); });\n",
      "However, as of 2023, the amount remains an outstanding balance even after all these years, raising serious doubts among the investors about the bond’s recoverability.\n",
      "Despite these uncertainties, PILIL has not set aside provisions for potential losses, potentially leading to inflated asset valuation and profits. The insurer initiated an arbitration process back in October 2020, securing a favourable ruling from the Arbitral Tribunal.\n",
      "Currently, the matter is under review by the High Court (case no 33/23), where hearings continue in PILIL's bid in investment recovery.\n",
      "Dubious short-terms\n",
      "Meanwhile, PILIL is facing grave concerns on another front over its short-term investment of Tk 178.32 crore in PFI Securities, reported as part of its financial statements for the year ending on December 31, 2023.\n",
      "This investment, carried forward since 2018, lacks any form of formal written agreement, raising bright red flags about the legitimacy and recoverability of the funds.\n",
      "The absences of documentation and the company’s failure to address potential risks have fuelled worries that PILIL’s financial statements may be overstating its assets. To recover the funds, the insurance company has filed two cases—No 109/2020 and 164/2020—against PFI Securities at the HC.\n",
      "The ongoing legal proceedings are critical in determining the insurer’s actual financial health and the resolution of this substantial investment.\n",
      "A satisfactory explanation\n",
      "Sterling Group, however, has challenged Prime Islami Life Insurance's financial statements, particularly a Tk 15 crore short-term investment involving four of Sterling’s concerns.\n",
      "The investment, outstanding since 2018, was made without a formal agreement, claims Sterling Group. This was also revealed in the IDRA investigation reporting.\n",
      "As with PILIL’s other questionable investments, no provisions have been made to cover potential losses, raising concerns regarding its overstatement of assets and profits. In response, PILIL has filed multiple cases (No 318/2020, 319/2020, 320/2020, and 321/2020) at the High Court against Sterling Group to recover the funds.\n",
      "The resolution of these ongoing legal proceedings will be crucial in determining the accuracy of the company’s financial disclosures.\n",
      "IDRA spokesperson Jahangir Alam stated that PILIL has been summoned for a hearing regarding the findings. If the company fails to provide a satisfactory explanation, legal action will follow, with the final decision pending the outcome of the hearing.\n",

      "Adviser to the interim government on the Ministries of Finance and Commerce Dr Salehuddin Ahmed has reiterated the government’s stance to curb extortion for putting a positive impact in the market and thus containing inflation further.\n",
      "“I’ve said time and again to take steps for curbing extortion . . . we’ve never said anything negative in this regard. We’ll definitely take steps,” he said.\n",

      "Mentioning that the issue of curbing extortion is not only an economic and trade related decision, Dr Salehuddin said, but it also has some political aspects associated with some social values.\n",
      "“Nothing remains vacuum as new elements fill the blank space. New people are filling up the vacuum of those who have already left … it will definitely take some time,” he added.\n",
      "Asked about the current inflationary situation as the general point to point inflation rate still hovers around 10.49 per cent in August, the adviser said the people are starting to get the message as inflation is already on the downtrend.\n",
      "“It’s not only work through boosting the supply side as some other issues are also related. We didn’t stop the supply side as we’re bringing more commodities like soybean oil and rice bran oil so that there is a deficit in the supply side.” he said.\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120733510-0\"); });\n",
      "The adviser went on saying, “Retail prices also matter … My stance is that no added pressure is put on the consumers,” he said, adding that the directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection (DNCRP) has been enforcing strict market monitoring in this regard.\n",
      "Dr Salehuddin also suggested for honestly looking into the government’s strict measures for market monitoring as the price of essentials would not come down all of a sudden.\n",
      "He alleged that there were many reasons for the high inflation trend in the past regime as more money was printed unwisely and it also had an impact on the market. “It will take some time to put everything in the right track.”\n",
      "The general point-to-point inflation rate in July, 2024 was 11.66 per cent, according to BBS.\n",
      "Asked about the meeting outcomes, the finance adviser said apart from continuing their ongoing funded projects, the UNDP has come up with ideas on some new projects.\n",
      "He said the UNDP has also expressed their interest in providing support in the government’s reform initiatives, in green technology, and continuing support in the health and education sector side by side in Bangladesh’s transition to LDC graduation.\n",
      "Responding to a question, the finance adviser said it requires technical assistance for carrying out any sort of reform while the UNDP is likely to provide technical assistance with expertise in this regard.\n",
      "“They (UNDP) were very much responsive and strongly said that they are committed to help us,” Salehuddin added.\n",

      "Bangladesh had witnessed inflation hitting over a decade high in July during the deadly protests. The Boishommo Birodhi Chhatra Andolon movement ultimately triggered the Hasina regime’s downfall, making way for the interim government to take charge on August 8.\n",
      "Several syndicates – who had the local consumer market in their grip for years – seem to have gone into hiding after the regime change, resulting in greater confidence in the overall economy, and a fall in living costs.\n",
      "This is evident by the fact that essential commodity prices in kitchen markets across the country barely saw an increase in August, despite several regions in Bangladesh suffering from one of the worst floods in recent history.\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120529839-0\"); });\n",
      "The latest inflation data prepared by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) reflects this analysis. The overall point to point inflation has dropped to 10.49 per cent in August, from 11.66 per cent in July this year. Inflation had stood at 9.92 per cent in August last year.\n",
      "Food inflation dipped in August as well, hitting 11.36 per cent in August, from 14.10 per cent in July. The non-food inflation was however increased slightly to 9.74 per cent in August, which was 9.68 per cent in July this year.\n",
      "Speaking with The Business Post, Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) Research Director Dr Mahfuz Kabir said, “I think the key reason behind the drop in inflation in August is the significant drop in transport sector exportation.\n",
      "“On the other hand, as a result of the political change, the syndicates that used to manipulate the wholesale markets in big cities are no longer active.”\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120733510-0\"); });\n",
      "He added, “It will take time to form a new syndicate. Besides, the Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection is more active than ever before. In some cases, students are also working to prevent syndicate activities. These have had a positive impact on stabilising product prices.”\n",
      "This researcher however believes that inflation could have dropped even more. “There was a huge loss of agricultural products due to sudden floods last month. If not for this loss, inflation might have gone into single digits in August,” he pointed out.\n",
      "He added that the price of products in the international market is decreasing, while the price of fuel oil has gone down in the domestic market to some extent. “As a result of this, I think the inflation in September will be lower compared to August,” Dr Kabir said optimistically.\n",
      "Despite the decrease in inflation in August, Bangladesh still has the highest inflation among South Asian countries, including Pakistan.\n",
      "Pakistan brought down inflation to 9.6 per cent in August. India and Sri Lanka are yet to publish August data. In July, India saw 3.4 per cent and Sri Lanka saw 2.5 per cent overall inflation.\n",
      "On the issue, Dr Kabir said, “The central banks of those countries have been able to keep inflation in check with a firm hand, maintaining order in the banking sector. But the role of Bangladesh Bank was not like that.\n",
      "“As a result, there was chaos in the banks, and a lot of money was laundered. Due to this, the price of the USD increased, which in turn caused the goods prices to skyrocket.”\n",
      "When asked how Pakistan is doing better than Bangladesh, Dr Kabir said, “Pakistan is not import dependent like Bangladesh. On the other hand, due to the decrease in reserves, Pakistan’s imports also dropped.\n",
      "“As a result, even though the USD rate in Pakistan remained higher than that of Bangladesh, it had no effect on that country’s product prices.”\n",
      "The interim government has put the most emphasis on taming inflation after assuming responsibilities. Keeping this goal in mind, the new central bank Governor and eminent economist Ahsan H Mansur recently increased the policy rate to 9 per cent.\n",
      "Mansur has already given the indication to further hike this rate to 10 per cent, and continue to hike it until inflation reined in to a tolerable level.\n",
      "Economists believe that raising the policy rate will increase interest rates on bank loans, discouraging people seeking to borrow from banks. As a result, the money flow in the market will decrease, and inflation will be in check.\n",
      "As part of the interim government’s much needed reform measures, the Bangladesh Bank is restructuring the boards of troubled banks marred by irregularities and corruption, from which thousands of crores of Taka have been taken out in the name of loans.\n",
      "Economists expect that such measures will gradually help check inflation in the coming years.\n",
      "Inflation is high in rural areas\n",
      "The BBS data – when making a comparison – shows that rural inflation is higher compared to urban area figures. The point-to-point general rural inflation was 10.95 per cent in August, while the urban inflation was 10.01 per cent in the same month.\n",
      "Meanwhile, food inflation is higher in villages compared to the cities, although agricultural products are produced in the rural areas. While food inflation was 11.24 per cent in urban areas in August, compared to 11.44 per cent in rural areas recorded in the same month.\n",
      "On the other hand, the demand for non-food items is lower in rural areas, compared to the urban areas. But the rate of such inflation is higher in rural areas than the urban.\n",
      "Meanwhile, non-food inflation was 9.20 per cent in urban areas in August, compared to 10.45 per cent in rural areas.\n",
      "Wages are not adjusting\n",
      "Wages are not increasing at the same rate as inflation. While overall inflation was 10.49 per cent in August this year, wage growth was only 7.96 per cent. It means the real income during the month is negative 2.53 per cent.\n",
      "Meanwhile, among the three sectors, the highest wage increase was in the agricultural sector at 8.25 per cent, followed by 8.24 per cent in services and 7.54 per cent in industry.\n",
      "Although the agricultural sector’s contribution to Bangladesh’s GDP has decreased, 40 per cent of the country’s total labour force is employed in this sector.\n",

      "Discussing the flow of foreign loans, the finance and commerce adviser pointed out, “The flow of foreign loans is just right, as those did not decrease at all. But there are many questions regarding their utilisation.\n",
      "“The three who came today (Sunday) are our development partners. We have spoken to all of them, and asked them to strengthen the ongoing support they had provided for so long.”\n",

      "“Discussions have been held with three development partner countries. They will engage more with us in the coming days.”\n",
      "During the parleys, he said the development partners have assured the government of providing more assistance and making more new engagements.\n",
      "Dr Salehuddin said the government wants from the development partners to reduce further the cost of interests and bringing in more low cost funding.\n",
      "Besides, the government also wants that the development partners extend the repayment period to at least 30 years as China has recently been requested in this regard. However, Japan is already complying with this, he added.\n",
      "Besides, the adviser said that discussions on funding projects in the physical infrastructure sector alongside energy, agriculture, disaster management also took place in the meetings.\n",

      "Bangladesh Bank (BB) has lifted the limit on cash withdrawals from banks in view of overall improvements in law and order.\n",
      "\"Cash withdrawal restrictions will no longer be applicable from Sunday onwards, Customers will be able to withdraw any amount of funds,\" said BB Executive Director and Spokesperson Md Mezbaul Haque.\n",
      "The relaxation comes a month after the BB imposed the restriction amidst deterioration in law and order.\n",

      "At that time, law enforcers were abstaining from their duties following deadly attacks and clashes centring an uprising which led to Sheikh Hasina's resignation from the post of prime minister on August 5.\n",
      "The central bank on August 7 asked banks to limit daily cash withdrawals to Taka one lakh per account.\n",
      "Since then, it has been gradually relaxing the cap.\n",
      "Last week, customers were barred from withdrawing over Tk 5 lakh a day per account.\n",

      "Adviser to the interim government on the Ministries of Finance and Commerce Dr Salehuddin Ahmed on Saturday said the government is taking strict measures to catch the godfathers of corrupt individuals in the financial sector, including money launderers.\n",
      "\"Already bank accounts of many of them have been seized. This is a primary initiative. Afterwards, there will be investigations and if found guilty, they will be punished,\" the adviser told reporters after a meeting at the Bangladesh Institute of Governance and Management (BIGM) in Dhaka.\n",
      "He mentioned that these measures will be implemented as soon as possible.\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120529839-0\"); });\n",
      "Asked about the high prices of essential commodities, Salehuddin said, \"It is not that the prices have not declined at all. The problem will not be solved quickly.\n",
      "Prices will gradually decline. Some initiatives have already been taken, for example, potato and onion import duty has been reduced.\"\n",
      "The adviser also said, \"The government is taking a strict stand against the market manipulators. Deputy Commissioners have been instructed to take measures. Regular market supervision will be done. But it is also necessary to see that the producers of the products get a fair price.\"\n",
      "Addressing the ongoing unrest in the garment sector, Salehuddin assured that the situation would become stable as the law enforcement agencies intensified their action against the perpetrators.\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120733510-0\"); });\n",
      "He noted that the authorities are actively targeting outsiders having ill intention in the Ashulia, Bypail, and Gazipura areas.\n",
      "“Discussions are ongoing on with owners, workers and political parties to mitigate the instability in the garment sector. The issue will be resolved soon,\" he added.\n",
      "Regarding the National Board of Revenue's (NBR) decision to cancel the opportunity to whiten black money, Salehuddun said the absence of such opportunities will enable the NBR to effectively nab the embezzlers.\n",

      "During the recent floods, thousands of poultry farms were submerged, and hundreds of thousands of chickens died in the Chattogram division, particularly in the Feni, Noakhali, Cumilla, and Lakshmipur districts.\n",
      "This has led to a decline in egg production and a reduced supply of meat, resulting in price hikes in the local market.\n",
      "The Bangladesh Poultry Association (BPA) reported that a total of 7.5 million chickens died in four districts of the Chattogram division during the floods. Of this, 4 million were broilers, 3 million sonali (local) chickens, and 5,00,000 were layer chickens.\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120529839-0\"); });\n",
      "Department of Livestock Services (DLS) in Chattogram stated that a total of 2.8-2.9 million chickens died across eight districts, excluding the Chittagong Hill Tracts.\n",
      "Meanwhile, egg production in these four districts declined to 2 million per day, which previously was 4 million per day. Other districts' egg production also declined to 1.5-2 million per day.\n",
      "BPA leaders stated that the average production cost is Tk 200 per broiler, Tk 800 per layer, and Tk 240 per Sonali chicken, resulting in a total loss of Tk 192 crore solely in poultry. Additionally, losses from eggs, grass, straw, feed, food grains, and infrastructure amount to over Tk 567 crore.\n",
      "Zakir Hossain, a flood- affected poultry farmer from Noakhali, said, \"I had about 60,000 layer chickens across my 30 farms where egg production was around 50,000 per day. Due to the floods, the number of eggs produced has dropped to 25,000 per day.\n",
      "googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1676120733510-0\"); });\n",
      "“Due to the floodwater, I couldn't feed the chickens for three days, and the eggs have rotted. The total loss, including chickens and fish, is around Tk one crore.”\n",
      "Like Zakir, many other farmers have been affected by the floods in Chattogram division. Zahid Hossain, another flood-victim of Chattogram’s Mirsarai, said, \"I had 80,000 broilers and layer chickens across 18 farms in Mirsarai and Feni’s Chhagalnaiya upazilas.\n",
      "“However, due to the floods, nearly 50,000 chickens have died in four farms in Mirsarai and seven farms in Chhagalnaiya. Although I had invested nearly Tk one crore in these farms, my losses have exceeded Tk 50 lakh.\"\n",
      "Poultry association leaders said that the average demand for eggs in Bangladesh is between 40-45 million pieces per day, while the demand for meat is 5,200 tonnes per day. Of which, the country’s egg production is around 40 million pieces per day. OF the meat supply, broilers account for 3,200 tonnes per day, and Sonali and layer chickens contribute around 1,700 tonnes.\n",
      "They further said that at present, nearly five per cent decline in egg production due to a daily decrease of approximately 2.2 million eggs. Additionally, the death of 7.5 million chickens has led to an over eight per cent decrease in meat supply.\n",
      "In four affected districts, floods have completely damaged 4,000 farms and partially damaged 2,000 others, resulting in losses ranging from Tk 10 lakh to Tk 2 crore.\n",
      "Dr AKM Humayun Kabir, Director of the Livestock Department in Chattogram, told The Business Post, “I am uncertain about the extent of poultry losses reported by farmers.”\n",
      "However, he acknowledged that the deaths of poultry and livestock in these districts would impact egg and meat production. He also mentioned that the department has informed the ministry to take necessary measures for the farmers.\n",
      "BPA President Md Suman Howlader told The Business Post, “Livestock Department's data is inaccurate. The department focuses on corporate groups and does not conduct proper field-level assessments. If you go to the field level, you will understand that there is a lump in their statistics.”\n",
      "According to the latest data from the Chattogram DLS on August 29, 47.91 million chickens in the 11 districts of Chattogram division were affected by the floods, and over 2.8 million chickens died. The report estimates a total loss of over Tk 450.27 crore in the livestock sector, including cattle, poultry, goats, as well as feed, eggs, and infrastructure.\n",
